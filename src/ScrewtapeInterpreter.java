 * 
 * - `>`: Move the tape pointer to the next memory node.
 * - `<`: Move the tape pointer to the previous memory node.
 * - `+`: Increment the value in the current memory node.
 * - `-`: Decrement the value in the current memory node.
 * - `.`: Output the character represented by the value in the current memory node.
 * - `[`: Do nothing
 * - `]`: If the value in the current memory node is not 0, jump back to the matching `[`.
 * 
 * This interpreter provides methods to manipulate the memory tape, execute programs, and handle loops efficiently.

   * The Screwtape language uses brackets `[` and `]` to define loops. This method identifies

   *

   * bracket at index 5. The returned map would contain a single entry: 
   * `{5: 0}`.

   * A few more examples:
   * 
   * input: `[+++][---]<<[+]`
   * output:`{4: 0, 9: 5, 14: 12}`
   * 
   * input: `[]`
   * output: `{1: 0}`
   * 
   * input: `>[+>[+-]<]`
   * output: `{9: 1, 7: 4}`
